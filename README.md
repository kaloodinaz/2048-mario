## 🕹️ What is 2048 Super Mario?

**2048 Super Mario – Japanese Version** is a fun and nostalgic twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game. Instead of merging numbered tiles, players combine iconic **Super Mario characters** and items inspired by the Japanese version of the beloved franchise.

Each merge reveals a new sprite from the retro Mario universe—think mushrooms, fire flowers, Yoshis, and even Bowser—all styled in pixel-perfect Japanese artwork.

## 📜 How to Play

- Use your **arrow keys** (← ↑ ↓ →) or swipe on mobile to move tiles.
- When two identical Mario tiles touch, they **merge into the next character** in the sequence.
- Your goal is to **reach the final Super Mario tile**!
- Game ends when there are no more valid moves.

## 🎨 Features

- 🧩 Classic 2048 mechanics with a Mario-themed twist  
- 🇯🇵 Authentic Japanese sprites and design  
- 💾 Works in any modern browser – no download required
